    <h1>Hello, Moze!</h1>
    <p>My first introduction to the world wide web was in 1994. I was at a computer lab at the University of South Florida and I was trying to find out the scores to some European soccer games. In those days, there was virtually no coverage on the television here, and I really didn't want to wait for the next day and read the results in the fine print of the sports section. To my surprise, ESPN's site had all the results posted within hours of the end of the games. I was amazed at the availability of information. It didn't matter to me that it displayed in simple black text on a white background and no style; just seeing the scores was all I needed.<p>
    <p>Fast forward to today, and there are streaming sites (many of them illegal) where you can watch virtually any game live. It's quite a difference.</p>
    <p>There are some downfalls to all of this progress. Spyware and Viruses are everywhere, so you need to be careful what sites you visit. As if that wasn't enough to worry about, even the most reputable sites need to pay their bills somehow, so advertisements, like AdChoices, are everywhere, even when you check your email.</p>
    <p>In addition to those challenges, the Internet Providers are continually trying to throttle access to the internet and create different tiers where you have to pay more money for fast speeds.</p>
    <p>So there's no telling where the internet will be in 10 years. Fortunately there are companies like Google offering alternatives like Fiber. In some cities in the U.S. the internet is free thanks to them. On a world-wide scale, Elon Musk wants everyone to have free access to the world wide web through his SpaceX missions. Let's hope these pioneers are successful in the flow of information to all people.</p>
